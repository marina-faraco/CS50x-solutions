sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Considering that Bubble Sort tends to be faster on already sorted lists (compared to
the other algorithms), and based on the real-time execution of sort1, it is more likely that sort1 uses Bubble Sort.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: Merge Sort is expected to be more efficient when dealing with unsorted lists; therefore,
based on the real-time execution of sort2, it can be assumed that sort2 uses Merge Sort.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Given that sort1 and sort2 have already been identified, and analyzing the real-time execution
of sort3 in all scenarios, it can be concluded that sort3 uses Selection Sort.
